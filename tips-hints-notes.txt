----IMPORTANT----------------------------------
This program tracks your minecraft advancements in almost real-time as you get them in-game. Whenever you get
an advancement the program will highlight it in green, and change the frame around it to brown, signifying it
is done. The reason i say "almost real-time", is because the one hiccup is that to add the advancement to the
program, you have to pause minecraft, specifically pressing "esc" for at least a brief moment. This is because
minecraft saves your advancements to the file whenever the player presses the "esc" key and brings up the
pause menu. However it's not terrible, because you can literally press it and press it again in less than a
second, and it will work.



----SET UP--------------------------------
Set-up is relatively easy, and can be broken down into a few steps:

1. Launch the file using ONE of these three methods:

	a: Double click the jar file
	b: Run it from the command line using the command "java -jar Advancements.jar"
	c: For Windows: open the Advancements.BAT file with a text editor, and change the "CHANGE_ME" to
 	   the location of the Advancements.JAR file. Now you can add it to your desktop and double click it.

2. Upon opening the program, it will ask you to choose the advancements file from your minecraft world.
   To find this depends on your operating system:

	Windows: /YOUR NAME/%appdata%/local/.minecraft/saves/advancements/a really long string of 
		 numbers and text, ending in .json
	Mac:     /Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves/advancements/a really long string of 
		 numbers and text, ending in .json
	Linux:   /home/YOUR NAME/.minecraft/saves/advancements/a really long string of 
		 numbers and text, ending in .json

   Once you find your file, select it and press "Open". The file chooser will close and you'll be taken to 
   the main program. If you already have some advancements, the program will highlight them in green.

3. Use the program! Every time you get an advancement in the game, press the esc key (even for just a moment)
   and the corresponding advancement will light up on the program! It's that easy! When you're done with the
   program, just close it! No need for safe shutdown, it's easy.



----TROUBLESHOOTING-----------------------
This is my first big java project, so there are bound to be a few bugs. i'll list a few known problems
and my way of fixing them:

	Q: The directions to the file you gave me were bullshit! Where is my folder?!?!?!?
	A: The directions I gave could be different depending on your computer. Try doing a broad search 
	   for "minecraft" if you can't find the folder. Google "where is my minecraft saves folder" if you
	   cant find it. The one part that should be the same is "minecraft/saves/advancements/file.json".

	Q: There's two json files in my advancements folder, what the fuck?
	A: Sometimes that happens, it's really weird. In my experience, one will start with an eight, and thats
	   the proper one to use. It couldn't hurt to try them both tho, theres no way my program can hurt
	   your file.

	Q: I'm getting errors like "no fucking clue where plain/oval/fancy/sprites is"
	A: My program is very scared of change, and is trying to point to the "frames" folder. Moving the program
	   out of its original folder or renaming the "frames" folder will fucking ruin it. The file hierarchy should
	   be the "frames" folder in the same directory as the "Advancements.JAR" file. This is why you should make
	   shortcuts instead of moving shit around!

	Q: I'm getting "Invalid File"
	A: This means you either didn't pick a real file, or you didn't choose anything at all.

	Q: I'm getting an error in the command line along the lines of "The java runtime used to compile this program
	   is JRE 58, but you are running JRE 52" or something like that. huh?
	A: I compiled this program using Java 14.02, and you don't have my version. do a google search for "JRE 15"
	   and download and update your JRE from Oracle's website. The one titled "JavaSE 15" is the one I use.

	Q: You keep writing "advancements", don't you mean achievements?
	A: NO. Achievements were replaced by advancements in 1.12, and while they are functionally the same thing,
	   this program will not be able to track achievements. Basically, If you're playing on 1.16, you will be fine.

If you find any bugs that these answers don't solve, or just want to know more about the program, email me at
"lowercaseadev@gmail.com"        (please don't send spam)



----FOR YOU-------------------------------
I'm writing this section for YOU. Yes you! the person who found this while searching for a better way to play minecraft!
the person who downloaded my program! personally I'm sure you're a great person, and I am eternally grateful that
you wanted to use MY program. Absolutely honored! Thank you so much :)



----FOR DEVELOPERS------------------------
All right now that the LOSERS (non-developers) are gone, I'll explain to you how the program works. It was written in
java with java swing, and works by combining two programs: one to track advancements, and the GUI to display those
advancements. It was compiled with JavaSE-14 (Java SE 14.02), and I'll be honest, I have no clue what that means
but I hope you do.



----THE END-------------------------------
Thank you for using my program. I really enjoyed writing it, and I hope you enjoy using it. If you have any questions,
criticism, or ideas on how to improve the program, email me at "lowercaseadev@gmail.com". thats "lowercase a dev".



Please have a wonderful day.

Sincerely,

Tommy
