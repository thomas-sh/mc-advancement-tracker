# mc-advancement-tracker
A Java program that runs alongside Minecraft 1.16 to track the progress made towards advancements. It tracks not only what you have completed, but also the progress made towards larger advancements, like "Adventuring Time" and "A Complete Catalogue".

This program was written between November 2020 and January 2021, and at the time was the largest project I had worked on. The only part that I did not write was the RelativeLayout class. This beautiful piece of code is credited to Rob Camick, whose code can be found here:
